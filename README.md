# travelAdventure
Statement: Travel is one of my hobbies. So far I have visited 13 countries in 4 continents. Many of my friends also enjoy travelling. So, I want to build a website that would help us to share some information from our trips between each other as well as other friends and family.
This website will provide information on what to do in each country and where to stay; there will be a map where you can search for places of interest. The access will be limited based on authorisation to make sure that data stays valid and accurate.
